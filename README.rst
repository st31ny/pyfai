-------------------------------------
Library for FAI customization scripts
-------------------------------------

This Python lib eases the implementation of FAI_ customization scripts with a
high level of abstraction and resonable error handling. It is meant to be
``import``'ed in scripts run by ``fai-do-scripts(1)`` during an FAI
installation or softupdate.
